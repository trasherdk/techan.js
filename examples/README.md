# Examples

Examples are git submodules pointing to gists which are viewable http://bl.ocks.org/ gists. Full gallery of available
examples can be viewed in the wiki [Examples Gallery](https://github.com/andredumas/techan.js/wiki/Gallery).

## Developing

By default they will be using online version of techanjs and d3. For local development, `grunt serve` (`grunt watch`)
is configured to make local development copies in `build/examples` replacing remote references to techanjs and d3 with
local build and bower dependencies.
